This project allows you to configure your complete NSPanel via a Blueprint with UI.
### *That means you don't have to customize any code or change any lines in the code.*

So you have a nice graphical interface where you can build your NSPanel.
And the best thing is, the installation takes only a few minutes.

The goal was to create a version that allows everyone to use the NSpanel fully local without having to deal with programming or reading hours of documentation - *AND YES WE DID IT!!!!* ;)

üìï Full documentation and installation is available here [NSPanel Configuration, Setup and HowTo](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint/wiki).
