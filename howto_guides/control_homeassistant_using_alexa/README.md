# Control homeassistant using alexa. No subscriptions or cloud services  
Learn how i control my homeassistant lights, scripts and devices using my amazon alexa with no cloud services needed and no subscriptions.
Unfortunatly the echo needs an internet connection to process any command. but the control of the devices is all happening in home locally.

## Install & Setup Node-Red
The first thing we need to do is install node-red.  
Node-red is an addon availiable in the supervisor section. (previously called Hass.io)  
* Make your way to the add-on store page, search and install the node-red addon.

* Follow the instalation instructions and start the node-red addon.  

## Setup Node-Red
Firstly we are going to install athe pallet.  
* go to the hamburger icon in the top right and click on manage pallet  
* Click on the install tab and search for `node-red-contrib-amazon-echo`
* install the pallet  

If you are using MQTT you need to add your broker in sop we can use the MQTT nodes.

* Drag out a MQTT node and double click it. 
* Give the Broaker a name. (`Mosquitto` for example) 
* Click the pencil next to server anc add your broaker server ip address.
* Click the security tab and add your MQTT username and password.
* Click Update in the top right 

## Now we need to create some flows  
### For Lights that are using MQTT we can set our flow like this
