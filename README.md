# Homeassistant info, examples and tips

This is my repository for reminding me how i did things regarding Homeassistant.  
If anyone is reading this, i may have not done things the conventional way, but... they worked for me.  
I am not a computer programmer in any way. Just a smart home enthusiast.  

I hope anyone who finds this repo makes use out of it.
I am trying to keep it up to date as much as possible and adding any new features or tips i come across.

When purchasing components and sensors, consider [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/index.php?zf=24584579) They have great prices and quick shipping times.  
90% of the sensors and components i use are from Banggood.  
Some links in this repository are affiliate links. When you purchase using them the product doesn't cost you any extra but i do get a kickback for my referral.  
Using these links helps me purchase more components to make new projects, so i can keep updating this repository.
