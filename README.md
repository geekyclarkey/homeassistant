# Homeassistant info, examples and tips

This is my repository for reminding me how i did things regarding Homeassistant.  
If anyone is reading this, i may have not done things the conventional way, but... they worked for me.  
I am not a computer programmer in any way. Just a smart home enthusiast.  

I hope anyone who finds this repo makes use out of it.
I am trying to keep it up to date as much as possible and adding any new features or tips i come across.
